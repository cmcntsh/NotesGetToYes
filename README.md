# Notes On Getting To Yes

## Fontmatter

### Preface 3rd Ed

* Over 30 years old

### Introduction

* You are a negotiator. Everyone negotiates every day.
* Soft - avoid personal conflict
* Hard - contest of wills
* 3rd way - Principled negotiation, hard AND soft, decide on merits, mutual gain

## Section I The Problem

### Ch 1 Don't bargain over positions

* 3 criteria to judge negotiation: 1) produce wise agreement, 2) be efficient 3) improve (or not damage) relationship between parties
* focus on interests, not just positions - What does everyone need?
* Problems with arguing over positions: inefficient, endangers relationships, problems worse with multiple parties
* "being nice" insufficient answer
* "hard or soft" insufficient dichotomy
* The alternative is positional bargaining
  * People - separate the people from the problem
  * Interests - focus on interests, not positions
  * Options - invent multiple options looking for mutual gains
  * Criteria - Insist results be based on objective standard
  * See table on page 13 for contrasting examples
* Stages:
  * Analysis - diagnose the situation based on 4 criteria above
  * Planning - review 4 criteria, consider options and make plans
  * Discussion - discuss the 4 criteria

## Section II The Method

### Ch 2 Separate the people from the problem

* Main interests: substantive interests, relationships with key individuals
* separate the people from the problem and deal with each separately
* Understand everyone's perceptions of the problem and perceived outcomes from their point of view.
* Don't let your fears dictate your understanding.
* Don't place blame.
* Discuss each other's perceptions.
* Act differently from people's perceptions (if negative).
* Encourage participation from everyone involved.
* Make your proposals consistent with others' values.
* Recognize and understand everyone's emotions.
* Pay attention to core concerns: autonomy, appreciation, affiliation, role, status.
* Consider the role of identiy.
* Make emotions explicit and acknowledge them as legitimate.
* Allow others to blow off steam.
* Don't react to emotional outbursts.
* Common problems with communication: playing to a 3rd party, not listening well to the other party, misunderstanding what the other party says.
* Use active listening.
* Get to know the other side personally.
* Face the problem, not the people.

### Ch 3 Focus on interests, Not positions

* Reconcile interests, not positions.
* Identify compatible and competing interests.
* Identify interests: ask why, ask why not.
* Realize each side has multiple interests.
* The most powerful interests are basic human needs.
* Make a list of interests.
* Put the problem before the answer.
* Be hard on the problem, but soft on the people.

### Ch 4 Invent options for mutual gain

* Four major obstacles to finding options: 1) premature judgement, 2) searching for single answer, 3) assumption of a fixed pie, 4) thinking finding a solution is the other party's problem.
* Prescription: 1) separate inventing options from judging them, 2) broaden options rather than seek single one, 3) search for mutual gains, 4) invent ways of making their decisions easy.
* Brainstorming: define purpose, choose few participants, change environment, informal atmosphere, choose a facilitator, sit side-by-side facing problem, clarify ground rules, suggest ideas, record all ideas in plain view.
* Post brainstorming: star most promising ideas, invent improvements for promising ideas, set up a time to evaluate ideas and decide.
* Multiply options: see circle chart on page 69

### Ch 5 Insist on using objective criteria

* Fair standards, fair procedures,
* Discuss criteria with other side: joint search for criteria, reason and be open to reason, yield to principle not pressure.

## Section III Yes, But...

### Ch 6 What if they are more powerful?

* Develop your BATNA - best alternative to negotiated agreement
* What is your bottom line?
* What is your trip wire? (Signal for you to examine things carefully.)

### Ch 7 What if they won't play?

* Focus on what you can do, negotiation jujitsu - focus on what the other side may do, what can a third party do?
* Don't attach the other party's position, look at what is going on behind it.
* Don't defend your ideas, invite criticism and advice.
* Recast an attack on you as an attack on the problem.
* Ask questions and pause.
* One text solution: understand interests and needs, seek criticism and revise, continue until it seems no better option is available.
